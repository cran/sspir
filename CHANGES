Function: filterstep (Kalman filter)

Suggestion by Fernando Tusell:

   I have experienced lots of troubles with kfilter returning -Inf as
   the value of the loglikelihood, and I think I have found the culprit.
   It will be fairly obvious to you, but if not I may supply a small
   reproducible example.

   When fitting structural models with variances close to zero (i.e., 
   near the feasibility boundary) matrix Q in function filterstep may
   have very small diagonal terms (and very small determinant). Variable
   logretval in function dmvnorm may become negative with a large value 
   (in one of my examples, -791.14). Nothing much would happen if you 
   had invoked it with argument log=TRUE: it would merrily return 
   -791.14.

   However, you invoke dmvnorm with the default log=FALSE, so it returns
   exp(-791.14) which is rounded to zero. THEN, you take the log of that
   (in filterstep) which nastily produces -Inf.

   I think replacing in filterstep,

        loglikterm <- log(dmvnorm(as.numeric(y), as.numeric(f), 
            Q))

   with

        loglikterm <- dmvnorm(as.numeric(y), as.numeric(f), 
            Q,log=TRUE))

   would solve the problem (and be faster and more accurate in
   all cases).
