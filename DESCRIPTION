Description: A glm-like formula language to define dynamic generalized
        linear models (state space models). Includes functions for
        Kalman filtering and smoothing. Estimation of variance matrices
        can be performed using the EM algorithm in case of Gaussian
        models. Read help(sspir) to get started.
